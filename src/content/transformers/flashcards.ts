      id: 'gpt-bpe',
      front: 'What is Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)?',
      back: 'A tokenization algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent character pairs to build a vocabulary. This allows models to handle both common words (as single tokens) and rare words (split into subwords).',

      id: 'gpt-transformer',
      front: 'What is the Transformer architecture?',
      back: 'A neural network architecture introduced in 2017 that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. It allows models to weigh relationships between all parts of a sequence simultaneously, enabling parallelization and capturing long-range dependencies.',

      id: 'gpt-attention',
      front: 'What is self-attention in transformers?',
      back: 'A mechanism that allows each token in a sequence to attend to (focus on) all other tokens, computing attention weights based on learned query, key, and value representations. This captures contextual relationships regardless of distance.',

      id: 'gpt-context-window',
      front: 'What is a context window?',
      back: 'The maximum number of tokens an LLM can process in a single prompt. Everything outside this window is invisible to the model. Modern LLMs support 128K to 2M tokens, but longer contexts are more expensive and can dilute important information.',

      id: 'gpt-rag',
      front: 'What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?',
      back: 'A technique that augments LLM prompts with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This helps models access up-to-date information and reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents.',

      id: 'gpt-embedding',
      front: 'What is an embedding in the context of AI?',

      id: 'gpt-finetuning',
      front: 'What is fine-tuning an LLM?',
      back: 'The process of continuing training a pre-trained model on a specific task or domain with curated data. This adapts the model\'s behavior, style, or knowledge without training from scratch.',

      id: 'gpt-rlhf',
      front: 'What is RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)?',
      back: 'A training technique that uses human preference data to fine-tune models via reinforcement learning. Humans rank model outputs, and a reward model is trained to predict preferences, which then guides the LLM to produce better responses.',

      id: 'gpt-hallucination',
      front: 'What is hallucination in LLMs?',
      back: 'When a model generates confident but factually incorrect or fabricated responses. This happens because LLMs are trained to predict likely text, not to verify facts. Mitigation includes RAG, fact-checking, and lower temperature settings.',

      id: 'gpt-temperature',
      front: 'What does temperature control in LLM sampling?',
      back: 'Temperature controls randomness in token selection. Lower values (0-0.3) produce deterministic, focused outputs. Higher values (0.7-1.0) add creativity and variation. Temperature of 0 always selects the highest probability token.',

      id: 'gpt-prompt-engineering',
      front: 'What is prompt engineering?',
